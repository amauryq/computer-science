Shrink VMWare Virtual Disks formatted with ext4

# sudo apt-get clean
# sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/0bits bs=20971520 # bs=20m
# sudo rm /0bits

This will manually clear unused space. Note that the first call to apt-get is not required, and only applicable if you’re running
a distribution that uses Debian’s advanced packaging tool for package management.

After you’ve executed these commands, shutdown your VM and use vmware-vdiskmanager to shrink the virtual drive file.

# cd "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation"
# vmware-vdiskmanager -k path\to\your\VirtualDisk.vmdk

You should see a noticeable reduction in file size after this.
